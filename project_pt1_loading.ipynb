As these steps are very long to run (a few hours), we created this separated preliminary notebook, that we only need to run once.\n","\n","In the following code, we read the full quotebank files for the period 2015-2020. As it is a very large dataset, we only select the quotes coming from three newspapers: the *New York Times*, *CNN* and *FOX News*. We then stock them in json files, and use these reduced datasets for our actual project (see `project_pt2_analyses.ipynb`).\n","\n","We also perfom a part of the quotations cleaning in this notebook, as it also requires a very long running time. This preprocessing consists in tokenizing and lemmatizing the quotes. The quotes are chopped into a collection of individual words (i.e. tokens), and each word is cutted down to its base form (lemmatization). For example: laugh, laughs, laughing, laughed would all be reduced to laugh. This reduces the complexity of analysis by reducing the number of unique words. Both techniques are built into the spaCy package, which is used in the `add_col_tokens` function from the `src` directory of the repository."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dNCfvyS1FEM3"},"source":["## Selecting newspapers quotes\n","\n","In this part, the full data set is loaded and only the dataset corresponding to newspapers quotations are selected and saved into 5 reduced size json files (2015-2020) for each newspaper.
