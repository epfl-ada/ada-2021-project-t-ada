As these steps are very long to run (a few hours..), we created a separate preliminary notebook, that we only need to run once. \n",

        "In the following code, we read the full quotebank files for 2015-2020. As it is a very large dataset, we select only the quotes coming from the New York Times newspaper. We then stock them in json files, and use these reduced datasets for our actual project (see `project_pt2_analyses.ipynb`).\n",

        "\n",
        "We also perfomed a part of the quotations cleaning in this notebook, as it also necessitates a very long running time. This preprocessing consists in tokenizing and lemmatizing the quotes. The quotes are chopped into a collection of individual words (i.e. tokens), and each word is cutted down to its base form (lemmatization). For example: laugh, laughs, laughing, laughed would all be reduced to laugh. This reduces the complexity of analysis by reducing the number of unique words. Both techniques are built into the spaCy package, which was used in the `text_tokenizer` function.\n",
